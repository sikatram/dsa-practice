# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my repository dedicated to practicing data structures and algorithms! This space is designed to help me enhance my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking through hands-on implementation and exercises.

## üéØ Focus
The repository will contain implementations of various data structures and algorithms in various programming languages. It will also include examples and exercises to reinforce my understanding of these concepts.

## üìÇ Structure
I have organized the repository with a date-based hierarchy (e.g., "1999/12/31"), where each day's directory contains multiple files for coding exercises. This setup allows me to track my progress and learning journey on a daily basis.

This approach helps me keep a clear record of my coding practice over time. I can easily review what I've learned, monitor my progress, and observe my growth in a structured manner.

Additionally, I maintain a global [diary.md](diary.md) file at the root of the project, where I document daily entries of new insights, criticisms, and reflections. The file also contains sections for key concepts, programming languages, and reminders. This file serves as a comprehensive record of my thoughts and observations throughout my learning process.

This project structure encourages daily consistency, promotes continuous learning, and supports detailed reflection on my experiences with coding, data structures, and algorithms.
