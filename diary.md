# Diary
This diary serves as a dynamic record of my coding endeavors, focusing on data structures and algorithms. Each entry captures my insights, struggles, and accomplishments. The diary is currently organized into four main sections.

**Concepts**: In this section, subjects are outlined, from mastering specific data structures and algorithms to understanding essential algorithmic analysis techniques.

**Languages**: In this section, I delve into various programming languages, to implement and understand algorithms and data structures.

**Reminders**: In this section, I jot down valuable insights and tips to remember for future attempts. This serves as a valuable repository of lessons learned, helping me avoid common pitfalls and continuously improve my coding skills over time.

**Entries**: Each entry is linked to a **entry.md** file in the respective day's directory. This dedicated file captures the attempt of that day's coding challenge, providing context and insights into my problem-solving approach and thought process.
